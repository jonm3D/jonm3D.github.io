We  repeat observations of the [Fukutoku-Okanaba volcano](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=284130) within a month of it's eruption in 2021, demonstrating the potential for monitoring the erosion and creation of new islands in remote locations. We compare ICESat-2 data to other space-based sensing methods, including visible imagery, stereo elevation models, and radar.

The DEM can be vertically controlled by means of ICESat-2 to sub-meter levels, as shown here. Photons labels as ground are in green and sea surface in red. </figcaption>
