This paper highlights the capability of ICESat-2 to monitor submarine volcanoes in remote locations. We made repeat observations of the [Fukutoku-Okanaba volcano](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=284130) within a month of it's eruption in 2021, demonstrating the possibility for monitoring erosion and bathymetry from space.
