title: "Assessing the Ability to Quantify Bathymetric Change over Time Using Solely Satellite-Based Measurements"

permalink: /publication/bathymetric-change
excerpt: 'This paper takes a first look at using bathymetric maps derived from ICESat-2 and satellite imagery to measure geomorphological change over time. Using a purely space-based approach to change detection in the Florida panhandle, we find similar patterns of sediment deposition when compared with airborne lidar surveys conducted in the same time window. I aided in the conceptualization of the study and the curation/validation of the ICESat-2 bathymetry data.

ICESat-2 bathymetry can be used to generate full bathymetric maps when combined with imagery from aerial or space-based platforms. This opens up the possibility of space-based bathymetric mapping at a global scale. However, the uncertainty of this method for mapping coastal change over time has not been studied. This paper addresses this gap using data from the Florida panhandle (Northern Gulf of Mexico) collected by Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 at two epochs to assess the feasibility of using ICESat-2/satellite-derived-bathymetry for change detection at scientifically relevant scales, spatial resolutions and accuracies. The comparison of the satellite-only result is compared to airborne data collected at similar epochs to reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively the utility of this technique.Â
