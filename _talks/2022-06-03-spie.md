I conducted the literature review of ICESat-2 bathymetry publications from 2018 to 2021 that served as the basis for this presentation.

Abstract: The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), on-orbit for nearly 3 years, continues to provide global elevation measurements to the broad science community. One of the most transformative discoveries during early mission operations was the realization that ICESat-2 could provide bathymetry in addition to the planned surface-specific data products for land ice, sea ice, ocean and land/vegetation. This is an important capability for coastal science, maritime intelligence and shallow water benthic monitoring at the global scale. ICESat-2 elevations are also becoming a critical component of satellite-derived bathymetry where multispectral imagery uses the measurements to create broad spatial maps with absolute vertical bathymetric depths. This article will highlight some of the most salient bathymetric observations and quantitative analyses of this space-based photon counting lidar that includes sea floor elevation retrievals but also environmental characterization such as wave structure and turbidity and monitoring of benthic habitats.
