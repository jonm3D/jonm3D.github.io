**Abstract**: Recent studies have demonstrated the combined use of NASAs ICESat-2 and spectrally-derived bathymetry (SDB) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 for mapping nearshore bathymetry in clear waters. With ICESat-2 having now been on orbit for three years, an opportunity exists to investigate whether these techniques will support analysis of bathymetric change over time. The short revisit cycles of the satellites make this capability of particular interest for assessment of bathymetric change, due to hurricanes or other episodic events. Applying uncertainty propagation to our previous ICESat-2/SDB bathymetric accuracy assessment results indicates that the level of bathymetric change needs to exceed ~1.5 m to be above the uncertainty floor. However, we posit that broad trends in bathymetric change (i.e., hurricane-induced seafloor erosion and deposition patterns) can be distinguished in the ICESat-2/SDB bathymetric difference grids, even if the pixel-level bathymetric difference grid uncertainties exceed the amount of actual change. We investigate this approach for assessing bathymetric change in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, due to recent hurricanes. High-accuracy airborne bathymetric lidar data collected by the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX) serve as the reference data. Specifically, we use JALBTCX elevation difference grids (2020 Post Hurricane Sally minus 2018 Post Hurricane Michael) as the reference, and generate ICESat-2/SDB difference grids using ICESat-2, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 data collected as close in time as possible to the two JALBTCX acquisition dates. Although the magnitude of bathymetric changes are generally < 1.2 m, clear storm sedimentation patterns can be discerned. Challenges to the approach include the need to hand-digitize land masks, optically deep water, and the inability to assess fine details in the spatial patterns of bathymetric change.
