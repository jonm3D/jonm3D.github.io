I am a PhD student using satellite data to solve challenges related to climate change. I currently work in the [3D Geospatial Laboratory](https://magruder3dgl.com/) at The University of Texas at Austin Department of Aerospace Engineering.

Research Interests
======
My work combines statistics, lidar/geospatial analysis, and environmental modeling utilizing NASA's [ICESat-2](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/icesat-2) space-based laser altimeter. ICESat-2 provides extremely high-accuracy global elevation measurements which are used to monitor [ice sheets](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5845), [boreal biomass](https://ceos.org/gst/icesat2-boreal-biomass.html), and [seafloor depths (aka bathymetry)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/14/1634). This can be a vital source of data for coastal/reef monitoring and safe maritime navigation in regions that would otherwise be hard to reach with survey teams.

Starting in September 2022, I will be supported by a NASA FINESST grant to study coastal elevation modeling with ICESat-2 and other satellite data. This research will be focused on Arctic environments where surveying is challenging due to sea ice and turbidity, but especially important as coastal erosion accelerates.
