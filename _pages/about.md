I am a PhD student using satellite data to solve challenges related to climate change. I currently work in the [3D Geospatial Laboratory](https://magruder3dgl.com/) at The University of Texas at Austin Department of Aerospace Engineering.

Research Interests
======
My work lies at the intersection of statistics, lidar/geospatial analysis, and environmental modeling. Much of my work utilizes observations from NASA's [ICESat-2](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/icesat-2), a space-based laser altimeter. ICESat-2 provides extremely high-accuracy global elevation measurements which are used to monitor glaciers, forests, and more. Importantly, this includes seafloor depths (aka bathymetry) up to 40m. This can be a vital source of data for coastal/reef monitoring and safe maritime navigation in regions that would otherwise be hard to reach with survey teams.

Starting in September 2022, I will be supported by a NASA FINESST grant to study coastal elevation modeling with ICESat-2 and other satellite data. This research will be focused on Arctic environments where surveying is challenging due to sea ice and turbidity, but especially important as coastal erosion accelerates.

The examples below shows what kind of data ICESat-2 can provide along coastlines.
