I am a PhD student and experienced Python developer using satellite data to solve challenges related to climate change, particularly relating to topographic change and elevation modeling. I currently work in the [3D Geospatial Laboratory](https://magruder3dgl.com/) at The University of Texas at Austin Department of Aerospace Engineering.

Research Interests
======
I am supported through a NASA FINESST graduate fellowship to investigate satellite-derived measurements of Arctic coastal change. This includes direct observations of shallow water bathymetry and nearshore coastal topography using ICESat-2 photon-counting lidar data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetry, and satellite-derived bathymetry using Sentinel-2 and other on-orbit optical imagery sources. I am especially driven to improve monitoring and resilience in coastal environments and the cryosphere - two key areas at the front lines of our changing climate.

I am especially excited to talk and learn about...
- Open-source geospatial software development
- Remote sensing product algorithms
- Cloud-native formats and infrastructure for analyzing Earth observation data

Additional work has been supported by the NASA ICESat-2 Science Team, the NASA Decadal Survey Incubation Surface Topography and Vegetation Team, and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency programs. 

I am currently seeking full-time staff research, software development, or analytics positions starting in the Summer of 2025.
