I am a PhD student using satellite data to solve challenges related to climate change, particularly relating to topographic change and elevation modeling. I currently work in the [3D Geospatial Laboratory](https://magruder3dgl.com/) at The University of Texas at Austin Department of Aerospace Engineering. I am supported through a NASA FINESST graduate fellowship to investigate satellite-derived measurements of Arctic coastal change. 

This includes direct observations of shallow water bathymetry and nearshore coastal topography using ICESat-2 photon-counting lidar data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetry, and satellite-derived bathymetry using Sentinel-2 and other on-orbit optical imagery sources. I am especially driven to improve monitoring and resilience in coastal environments and the cryosphere.

Extra-excited to talk about...
- Open-source geospatial software development
- Remote sensing product algorithm design
- Cloud-native formats and infrastructure for Earth observation data
